**Welcome to the [Helma NG][ng:] demo application.** 
Helma NG is a Javascript runtime and web application framework running on
the Java virtual machine.
"NG" stands for "next generation", meaning that it is a more of a rewrite of
Helma 1 than simply a new version.

Helma NG consists of several components that can be used together or alone:

  1. A compact JavaScript runtime environment based on Mozilla Rhino. It adds
     to Rhino a reloading module system that is compatible to the ServerJS
     Securable Module proposal.

  2. An interactive shell with support for autocompletion and history.

  3. A module library implemented in JavaScript, covering basic functionality
     such as extensions to the built-in objects, file I/O, logging, persistence,
     client and server side HTTP support and more.

This app shows some of the features in Helma NG. As the version number suggests,
Helma NG is far from finished. Check [the Helma NG site][ng:]
regularly to keep up with development.
