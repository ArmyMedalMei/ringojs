Helma NG uses [Apache log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html) as logging framework.

The helma/logging modules also acts as [middleware][ng:middleware] that allows you to append log
messages to the page being rendered, which is very useful during development.

 * <a href="?info=1">Click here</a> to generate a simple log message.
 * <a href="?error=1">Click here</a> to gnereate an error log message including a stack trace.

Helma NG also comes with a JavaScript profiler middleware that gives you information on what functions
were invoked how often and how long they took to execute. The profiler uses the logging module
to display this data.

 * <a href="?profile=1">Click here</a> to enable the profiler and see its output.
